Project Goal: Develop a system to automatically detect and classify toxic comments in online environments.

Toxic comments create a hostile and negative online environment, impacting user experience and potentially leading to harassment and bullying. This project aims to address this issue by building a robust and effective comment toxicity detection system.

Methodology:


1.Data Acquisition: Collect a large dataset of labeled comments, where each comment is categorized as toxic or non-toxic.
2.Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for model training. This may involve techniques like removing irrelevant information, correcting typos, and handling missing data.
3.Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the text data, such as sentiment analysis, word embeddings, and n-grams.
4.Model Training: Train different machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests, or Deep Learning models, to classify comments as toxic or non-toxic. Evaluate and compare the performance of different models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.


Expected Benefits:

1.Improved user experience: By filtering out toxic comments, online platforms can create a more positive and inclusive environment for users.
2.Reduced harassment and bullying: Automatic detection and removal of toxic comments can help to prevent harassment and bullying online.


Technical Skills:

1.Machine Learning(Scikit-learn)
2.Natural Language Processing (NLP)
3.Text Classification
4.Deep Learning (TensorFlow)
5.Python Programming



This project offers a valuable opportunity to leverage Machine Learning and NLP techniques to address a critical issue in the online world. By developing an effective comment toxicity detection system, you can contribute to creating a safer and more positive online environment for everyone.
